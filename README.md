# Leaf-Spine-Arch-project
Simulation and analysis of a Leaf-Spine network in OMNeT++ to assess performance under varied conditions. The project models a scalable, low-latency data center topology and evaluates throughput, delay, and packet loss to reveal efficiency, bottlenecks, and suitability for high-performance environments.
